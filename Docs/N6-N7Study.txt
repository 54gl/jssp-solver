Studying N6 and N7 neighborhoods on Balas and Zhang.




(Zhang - Theorem 1)
Move u -> v is OK if not exists path from JS(u) to v.


(Zhang - Theorem 2)
Move u <- v is OK if not exists path from u to JP(v)

Move u->v can be evaluated in a linear recursive manner from data in machine block [u,v]  
Move u<-v can be evaluated in a linear recursive manner from data in machine block [u,v]
